                <p style="padding: 1%;margin-left: 2%;">The precision landing was made possible by recalibrating the descending trajectory and recording the lunar surface with the help of AI-powered instruments like velocimeters, altimeters, and accelerometers. The three primary parts of Chandrayaan-3 were the propulsion module, the lander (Vikram), and the rover (Pragyan).

        <div class="techinfo">
         <i><p> Chandrayaan-3 is a highly complex mission that uses a variety of cutting-edge technologies. Some of the key technologies used in the mission include:</p>
         <p><b>Propulsion systems</b> Chandrayaan-3 is powered by a combination of solid-fuel and liquid-fuel rockets. The solid-fuel rockets are used for the initial launch and ascent to orbit, while the liquid-fuel rockets are used for orbital maneuvers and the soft landing on the Moon.</p>
         <p><b>Onboard sensors</b> Chandrayaan-3 is equipped with a variety of onboard sensors, including cameras, spectrometers, and magnetometers. These sensors are used to collect data about the Moon's surface, environment, and gravity field.</p>
         <p><b>Communication technology</b> Chandrayaan-3 communicates with Earth using a variety of communication systems, including S-band, X-band, and UHF. These systems allow the spacecraft to transmit data to Earth and receive commands from mission control.</p>
         <p><b>Navigation, guidance, and control (NGC) system</b> Chandrayaan-3's NGC system is responsible for the spacecraft's navigation, guidance, and control. The NGC system uses a combination of sensors, computers, and actuators to ensure that the spacecraft remains on its desired trajectory.</p>
         <p><b>AI-powered landing system</b> Chandrayaan-3's lander uses an AI-powered landing system to achieve a soft landing on the Moon. The AI system uses data from the lander's sensors to identify and avoid obstacles on the Moon's surface.</p></i>

          <p><b>New navigation system</b>
            The new navigation system used in Chandrayaan-3 is called the Terrain Relative Navigation System (TRNS). TRNS is an AI-powered system that uses a variety of sensors, including cameras, altimeters, and accelerometers, to generate a real-time 3D map of the Moon's surface. The system then uses this map to guide the spacecraft to a safe landing spot.            
            TRNS is a significant improvement over previous navigation systems used for lunar landings. Previous systems were based on pre-programmed maps of the Moon's surface, which could be inaccurate or outdated. TRNS, on the other hand, generates a real-time map of the Moon's surface, which allows it to compensate for any changes in the landscape.            
         </p>
          <p><b>New rover</b> The new rover used in Chandrayaan-3 is called the Pragyan rover. Pragyan is a six-wheeled rover that is equipped with a variety of sensors and instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a ground penetrating radar. The rover is designed to explore the Moon's surface and collect data about its geology, mineralogy, and environment.</p>
          <p><b>New lander</b>The new lander used in Chandrayaan-3 is called the Vikram lander. Vikram is a four-legged lander that is equipped with a variety of sensors and instruments, including cameras, altimeters, and accelerometers. The lander is designed to deliver the Pragyan rover to the Moon's surface safely. </p>
